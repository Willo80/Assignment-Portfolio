## Description of my website

### Purpose
- the purpose of my website is to demonstrate my capabilities in HTML and CSS in the form of a portfolio.
  
  ### Functioanlity and Features
  - My portfolio webiste has 5 pages, Home page, About me, Portfolio (work portfolio), Blog and Contact page. There is however a page which is a .html page wherby the user is taken to this page to learn more or read more about a blog article or work project. (Mock-up)
  - There are many clickable (interactive) links, and opportunity to doenlad my resume as a pdf and print or save.

### Sitemap
- I have included a copy of the site map in the docs folder. Originally I had a very ambitious site map, and soon realised that my skills to time to completion ratio were not quite right. I settled for this site map that could demonstrate my capability level at this stage.
- The wireframes are included in the doc folder, I used Figma for a mock up design build. This gave me an idea of how I wanted the site to look without the distraction of colours or images, as well as the placement of the elements.

### Screenshots
The screen shot are a part of the PDF(PPT) presentation and will take you through each page of the website - there are comment as exaplantions for each of these pages in the pdf.

### Target Audience
The target audience would be potential employees looking to employ a junior web developer.

### Texh stack
- html and css is used for the design in VS code, and the website has been deployed on Netlify.
