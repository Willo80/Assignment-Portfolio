                This is me Carol North, adverturing around our farm with Cyclone Sally. When I am not at my desk designing and developing training modules, you will find me playing piano, running the trails, making preserves or learning the ukulele.

                Being active and learning new skills is a driver for me. I believe in balancing my career with work and play, and managed to juggle these important aspects of my life very well.

                To further develop my capabilites as a learning and development content creator, I recently qualified as a junior Web Deveoper. Take a look at my work portfolio and resume below, and get in touch.
